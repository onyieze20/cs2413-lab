# Lab00 Starter Demo (GitHub + C)

## Purpose
This lab is a simple warm-up to practice:
- Forking the course repo
- Cloning your fork
- Editing code
- Compiling with `make`
- Running a program
- Committing and pushing changes to GitHub

This lab is NOT graded for correctness of a data structure problem.
It is only a setup + workflow practice.
